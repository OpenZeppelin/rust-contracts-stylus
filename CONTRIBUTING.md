# Contributing Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to OpenZeppelin Contracts for Stylus.

## Troubleshooting

You can help other users in the community to solve their smart contract issues
in the [OpenZeppelin Forum].

[OpenZeppelin Forum]: https://forum.openzeppelin.com/

## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue] to suggest a feature or report a minor bug.

If you believe your issue may be due to user error and not a problem in the
library, consider instead posting a question on the [OpenZeppelin Forum].

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed
issues, and consider posting a comment in one of those instead.

When requesting a new feature, include as many details as you can, especially
around the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritized according to
the impact they may have on the ecosystem, so we appreciate information showing
that the impact could be high.

## Submitting a pull request

If you would like to contribute code or documentation you may do so by forking
the repository and submitting a pull request.

Any non-trivial code contribution must be first discussed with the maintainers
in an issue (see [Opening an issue](#opening-an-issue)). Only very minor
changes are accepted without prior discussion.

Make sure to read and follow the [engineering guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md). Run
linter and tests to make sure your pull request is good before submitting it.
