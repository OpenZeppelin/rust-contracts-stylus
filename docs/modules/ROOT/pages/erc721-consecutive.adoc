= ERC-721 Consecutive

Consecutive extension for xref:erc721.adoc[ERC-721] is useful for efficiently minting multiple tokens in a single transaction. This can significantly reduce gas costs and improve performance when creating a large number of tokens at once.

== Usage

In order to make https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/0.3.0-alpha.1/openzeppelin_stylus/token/erc721/extensions/consecutive/index.html[`ERC-721 Consecutive`] methods “external” so that other contracts can call them, you need to add the following code to your contract:
