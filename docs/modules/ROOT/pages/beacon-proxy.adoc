= Beacon Proxy

Beacon Proxy is an advanced proxy pattern that allows multiple proxy contracts to share a single beacon contract that determines their implementation. This pattern is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to upgrade multiple proxy contracts simultaneously by updating a single beacon.

The OpenZeppelin Stylus Contracts provides a complete implementation of the Beacon Proxy pattern, including the `BeaconProxy` contract and `UpgradeableBeacon` contract.

== Understanding Beacon Proxy

The Beacon Proxy pattern consists of three main components:

1. **Beacon Contract**: A contract that stores the current implementation address.
2. **Beacon Proxy**: Multiple proxy contracts that delegate to the beacon for their implementation.
3. **Implementation Contract**: The actual logic contract that gets executed.

=== How It Works

1. Multiple `BeaconProxy` contracts are deployed, each pointing to the same `UpgradeableBeacon`.
2. The `UpgradeableBeacon` stores the current implementation address.
3. When a call is made to any `BeaconProxy`, it queries the beacon for the current implementation.
4. The proxy then delegates the call to that implementation.
5. To upgrade all proxies, you only need to update the beacon's implementation.

=== Benefits

* **Mass Upgrades**: Upgrade multiple proxies with a single transaction.
* **Gas Efficiency**: Shared beacon reduces storage costs.
* **Consistency**: All proxies always use the same implementation.
* **Centralized Control**: Single point of control for upgrades.
* **Trust Minimization**: Proxies can verify the beacon's implementation.

== Basic Beacon Proxy Implementation

Here's how to implement a basic beacon proxy:

[source,rust]
----
use openzeppelin_stylus::proxy::{
    beacon::{proxy::BeaconProxy, IBeacon},
    erc1967,
    IProxy,
};
use stylus_sdk::{
    abi::Bytes,
    alloy_primitives::Address,
    prelude::*,
    ArbResult,
};

#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct MyBeaconProxy {
    beacon_proxy: BeaconProxy,
}

#[public]
impl MyBeaconProxy {
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        &mut self,
        beacon: Address,
        data: Bytes,
    ) -> Result<(), erc1967::utils::Error> {
        self.beacon_proxy.constructor(beacon, &data)
    }

    /// Get the beacon address
    fn get_beacon(&self) -> Address {
        self.beacon_proxy.get_beacon()
    }

    /// Get the current implementation address from the beacon
    fn implementation(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        self.beacon_proxy.implementation()
    }

    /// Fallback function that delegates all calls to the implementation
    #[fallback]
    fn fallback(&mut self, calldata: &[u8]) -> ArbResult {
        unsafe { self.do_fallback(calldata) }
    }
}

unsafe impl IProxy for MyBeaconProxy {
    fn implementation(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        self.beacon_proxy.implementation()
    }
}
----

== Upgradeable Beacon Implementation

The `UpgradeableBeacon` contract manages the implementation address and provides upgrade functionality:

[source,rust]
----
use openzeppelin_stylus::{
    access::ownable::{IOwnable, Ownable},
    proxy::beacon::{IBeacon, IUpgradeableBeacon, UpgradeableBeacon},
};
use stylus_sdk::{
    alloy_primitives::Address,
    prelude::*,
};

#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct MyUpgradeableBeacon {
    beacon: UpgradeableBeacon,
}

#[public]
impl MyUpgradeableBeacon {
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        &mut self,
        implementation: Address,
        initial_owner: Address,
    ) -> Result<(), beacon::Error> {
        self.beacon.constructor(implementation, initial_owner)
    }

    /// Upgrade to a new implementation (only owner)
    fn upgrade_to(
        &mut self,
        new_implementation: Address,
    ) -> Result<(), beacon::Error> {
        self.beacon.upgrade_to(new_implementation)
    }
}

#[public]
impl IBeacon for MyUpgradeableBeacon {
    fn implementation(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        self.beacon.implementation()
    }
}

#[public]
impl IOwnable for MyUpgradeableBeacon {
    fn owner(&self) -> Address {
        self.beacon.owner()
    }

    fn transfer_ownership(&mut self, new_owner: Address) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        self.beacon.transfer_ownership(new_owner)
    }

    fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        self.beacon.renounce_ownership()
    }
}

#[public]
impl IUpgradeableBeacon for MyUpgradeableBeacon {
    fn upgrade_to(&mut self, new_implementation: Address) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        Ok(self.beacon.upgrade_to(new_implementation)?)
    }
}
----

== Custom Beacon Implementation

You can also implement your own beacon contract by implementing the `IBeacon` trait:

[source,rust]
----
use openzeppelin_stylus::proxy::beacon::IBeacon;
use stylus_sdk::{
    alloy_primitives::Address,
    prelude::*,
    storage::StorageAddress,
};

#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct MyCustomBeacon {
    implementation: StorageAddress,
    admin: StorageAddress,
}

#[public]
impl MyCustomBeacon {
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(&mut self, implementation: Address, admin: Address) {
        self.implementation.set(implementation);
        self.admin.set(admin);
    }

    /// Upgrade implementation (only admin)
    fn upgrade_implementation(&mut self, new_implementation: Address) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        if self.admin.get() != msg::sender() {
            return Err("Only admin can upgrade".abi_encode());
        }

        if !new_implementation.has_code() {
            return Err("Invalid implementation".abi_encode());
        }

        self.implementation.set(new_implementation);
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[public]
impl IBeacon for MyCustomBeacon {
    fn implementation(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        Ok(self.implementation.get())
    }
}
----

== Constructor Data

Like ERC-1967 proxies, beacon proxies support initialization data:

[source,rust]
----
impl MyBeaconProxy {
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        &mut self,
        beacon: Address,
        data: Bytes,
    ) -> Result<(), erc1967::utils::Error> {
        // If data is provided, it will be passed to the implementation
        // returned by the beacon during construction via delegatecall
        self.beacon_proxy.constructor(beacon, &data)
    }
}
----

The `data` parameter can be used to:

* **Initialize storage**: Pass encoded function calls to set up initial state.
* **Mint initial tokens**: Call mint functions on token contracts.
* **Set up permissions**: Configure initial access control settings.
* **Empty data**: Pass empty bytes if no initialization is needed.

=== Example: Initializing with Data

[source,rust]
----
use alloy_sol_macro::sol;
use alloy_sol_types::SolCall;

sol! {
    interface IERC20 {
        function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external;
    }
}

// In your deployment script or test
let beacon = deploy_beacon();
let implementation = deploy_implementation();
let initial_owner = alice;
let initial_supply = U256::from(1000000);

// Encode the mint call
let mint_data = IERC20::mintCall {
    to: initial_owner,
    amount: initial_supply,
}.abi_encode();

// Deploy beacon proxy with initialization data
let proxy = MyBeaconProxy::deploy(
    beacon.address(),
    mint_data.into(),
).expect("Failed to deploy beacon proxy");
----

== Storage Layout Safety

Beacon proxies use ERC-1967 storage slots for safety:

=== Benefits

* **No Storage Collisions**: Implementation storage cannot conflict with proxy storage.
* **Predictable Layout**: Storage slots are standardized and well-documented.
* **Upgrade Safety**: New implementations can safely use any storage layout.
* **Gas Efficiency**: No need for complex storage gap patterns.

=== Implementation Storage

Your implementation contract can use any storage layout without worrying about conflicts:

[source,rust]
----
#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct MyToken {
    // These fields are safe to use - they won't conflict with beacon proxy storage
    balances: StorageMapping<Address, U256>,
    allowances: StorageMapping<(Address, Address), U256>,
    total_supply: StorageU256,
    name: StorageString,
    symbol: StorageString,
    decimals: StorageU8,
    // ... any other storage fields
}
----

== Best Practices

1. **Trust the beacon**: Ensure you control or trust the beacon contract, as it determines all proxy implementations.

2. **Use proper access control**: Implement admin controls for beacon upgrade functions.

3. **Test mass upgrades**: Ensure all proxies work correctly after beacon upgrades.

4. **Monitor beacon events**: Track beacon upgrades for transparency.

5. **Handle initialization data carefully**: Only send value when providing initialization data.

6. **Document beacon ownership**: Clearly document who controls the beacon.

7. **Use standardized slots**: Don't override the ERC-1967 storage slots in your implementation.

8. **Consider beacon immutability**: Beacon proxies cannot change their beacon address after deployment.

== Common Pitfalls

* **Untrusted beacon**: Using a beacon you don't control can lead to malicious upgrades.
* **Beacon immutability**: Beacon proxies cannot change their beacon address after deployment.
* **Missing access control**: Protect beacon upgrade functions with proper access control.
* **Storage layout changes**: Be careful when changing storage layout in new implementations.
* **Incorrect initialization data**: Ensure initialization data is properly encoded.
* **Sending value without data**: Beacon proxies prevent sending value without initialization data.

== Use Cases

Beacon proxies are particularly useful for:

* **Token Contracts**: Multiple token instances sharing the same implementation.
* **NFT Collections**: Multiple NFT contracts with identical logic.
* **DeFi Protocols**: Multiple vault or pool contracts.
* **DAO Governance**: Multiple governance contracts.
* **Cross-chain Bridges**: Multiple bridge contracts on different chains.
