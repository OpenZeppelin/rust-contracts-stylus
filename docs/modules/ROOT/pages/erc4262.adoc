= ERC-4262

ERC4626 is an extension of ERC20 that proposes a standard interface for token vaults. This standard interface can be used by widely different contracts (including lending markets, aggregators, and intrinsically interest bearing tokens), which brings a number of subtleties. Navigating these potential issues is essential to implementing a compliant and composable token vault.
