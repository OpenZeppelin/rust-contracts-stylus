= UUPS Proxy

The Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) is a minimal and gas-efficient
pattern for upgradeable contracts. Defined in the xref:https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822[ERC-1822]
specification, UUPS delegates upgrade logic to the implementation contract
itself — reducing proxy complexity and deployment costs.

The OpenZeppelin Stylus Contracts provide a full implementation of the UUPS pattern via `UUPSUpgradeable` and `Erc1967Proxy`.

== Overview

UUPS uses the ERC-1967 proxy architecture to separate upgrade logic from proxy behavior. Instead of maintaining upgradeability in the proxy, all upgrade control is implemented within the logic contract.

Key components:

- **Proxy Contract (`Erc1967Proxy`)** — delegates calls via `delegate_call`.
- **Implementation Contract** — contains application logic and upgrade control.
- **Upgrade Functions** — reside in the implementation, not the proxy.

In Solidity, upgrade safety often relies on an `immutable` self-address and context checks. Stylus, however, uses a small adaptation that is covered below.

== Context Detection in Stylus

Stylus does not currently support the `immutable` keyword. Instead of storing `__self = address(this)`, the implementation uses a dedicated boolean flag in a unique storage slot to distinguish direct vs delegated (proxy) execution contexts.

[source,rust]
----
// boolean flag stored in a unique slot
logic_flag: bool;
----

The implementation’s constructor sets `logic_flag = true` in the implementation’s own storage. When code runs via a proxy (delegatecall), the proxy’s storage does not contain this flag, so reads as `false`. This enables `only_proxy()` to check for delegated execution without relying on an address sentinel.

== Initialization

Stylus requires explicit initialization for both the implementation and the proxy:

- **Constructor** – called exactly once on deployment of the logic (implementation) contract. This sets the implementation-only `logic_flag` used for context checks.
- **Version setup (`set_version`)** – called via the proxy (delegatecall) to write the logic’s `VERSION_NUMBER` into the proxy’s storage. This aligns the proxy’s version with the logic and enables upgrade paths guarded by `only_proxy()`.

[NOTE]
==== 
If `set_version()` is not called via the proxy, `only_proxy()` will reject upgrade attempts due to version mismatch. This is recoverable by calling `set_version()` later via the proxy.
==== 

**Trade-offs:**

- **Storage Cost:** Requires one additional storage slot.
- **Runtime Safety:** Maintains the same guarantees as the Solidity version.
- **Gas Impact:** One-time cost during initialization; negligible runtime overhead.

== Why UUPS?

- **Gas Efficient** — Upgrades are handled within the logic contract.
- **Secure** — Authorization and validation are managed in one place.
- **Standardized** — Conforms to ERC-1822 and ERC-1967.
- **Flexible** — Upgrade logic can include custom access control and validation.
- **Safe by Design** — Uses dedicated ERC-1967 slots to prevent storage collisions.

== How It Works

. Deploy `Erc1967Proxy` with an initial implementation and encoded `setVersion` data.
. Proxy delegates all calls to the implementation contract via `delegate_call`.
. Implementation exposes `upgrade_to_and_call`, guarded by access control (e.g. `Ownable`).
. Upgrades validate the new implementation using `proxiable_uuid()`.
. Stylus uses a two-step pattern: `constructor` on logic deployment, then `set_version` during proxy setup.

== Implementing a UUPS Contract

Minimal example with `Ownable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`, and `Erc20` logic:

[source,rust]
----
#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct MyUUPSContract {
    erc20: Erc20,
    ownable: Ownable,
    uups: UUPSUpgradeable,
}

#[public]
#[implements(IErc20<Error = erc20::Error>, IUUPSUpgradeable, IErc1822Proxiable, IOwnable)]
impl MyUUPSContract {
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        &mut self,
        initial_owner: Address,
    ) -> Result<(), ownable::Error> {
        self.uups.constructor();
        self.ownable.constructor(initial_owner)
    }

    /// Aligns the proxy's version with this logic. Call this via the proxy once.
    fn set_version(&mut self) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        self.uups.set_version().map_err(Into::into)
    }

    fn mint(&mut self, to: Address, value: U256) -> Result<(), erc20::Error> {
        self.erc20._mint(to, value)
    }
}

#[public]
impl IUUPSUpgradeable for MyUUPSContract {
    #[selector(name = "UPGRADE_INTERFACE_VERSION")]
    fn upgrade_interface_version(&self) -> String {
        self.uups.upgrade_interface_version()
    }

    fn upgrade_to_and_call(&mut self, new_impl: Address, data: Bytes) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        // Make sure to provide upgrade authorization in your implementation
        // contract.
        self.ownable.only_owner()?; // authorization
        self.uups.upgrade_to_and_call(new_impl, data)?; // perform upgrade
        Ok(())
    }
}

== Implementing the Proxy

A simple UUPS-compatible proxy using ERC-1967:

[source,rust]
----
#[entrypoint]
#[storage]
struct MyUUPSProxy {
    proxy: Erc1967Proxy,
}

#[public]
impl MyUUPSProxy {
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(&mut self, implementation: Address, data: Bytes) -> Result<(), erc1967::utils::Error> {
        self.proxy.constructor(implementation, &data)
    }

    fn implementation(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        self.proxy.implementation()
    }

    #[fallback]
    fn fallback(&mut self, calldata: &[u8]) -> ArbResult {
        unsafe { self.proxy.do_fallback(calldata) }
    }
}

unsafe impl IProxy for MyUUPSProxy {
    fn implementation(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        self.proxy.implementation()
    }
}
----

== Upgrade Safety

=== 1. Access Control

Upgrades must be restricted to trusted accounts, e.g. via `only_owner`:

[source,rust]
----
self.ownable.only_owner()?;
----

=== 2. Proxy Context Enforcement

Ensures upgrade calls come from a delegate call:

[source,rust]
----
self.uups.only_proxy()?; // Reverts if not called via proxy
----

**Explanation:**
`only_proxy()` checks that execution is delegated (not direct), the caller is an ERC-1967 proxy (implementation slot is non-zero), and the proxy-stored version equals the logic’s `VERSION_NUMBER`.

=== 3. Proxiable UUID Validation

Guarantees compatibility with UUPS:

[source,rust]
----
self.uups.proxiable_uuid()? == IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
----

== Initialization

The UUPS proxy supports initialization data that is delegated to the implementation on deployment. This is typically used to invoke `set_version` first, and optionally invoke your own initialization routines (e.g., ownership or token supply setup) if needed.

[source,rust]
----
let data = IMyContract::setVersionCall {}.abi_encode();
MyUUPSProxy::deploy(implementation_addr, data.into());
----

=== ⚠️ Initialization Must Be Explicit (Your Contract State)

If your contract needs additional initialization beyond `set_version()` (e.g., ownership, token supply), expose a properly designed initialization function and protect it appropriately (e.g., single-use guard or access control). Failing to do so can lead to:
* Orphaned contracts with no owner.
* Uninitialized token supply or core state.
* Denial of future upgrades if your own guards are misused.

[source,rust]
----
/// Optional contract initialization (example).
fn init_contract_state(&mut self, owner: Address) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
    self.ownable.constructor(owner)?;
    
    /// other initialization logic...

    self.uups.set_version()?;

    Ok(())
}
----

NOTE: If you expose additional initialization functions, ensure they are protected from re-execution after the proxy is live.

== Initializing the Proxy

Initialization data is typically a call to the implementation’s `set_version` function:

[source,rust]
----
let data = IMyContract::setVersionCall {}.abi_encode();
MyUUPSProxy::deploy(implementation_addr, data.into());
----

This setup call is run via `delegate_call` during proxy deployment.

== Security Best Practices

* Restrict upgrade access (e.g. `only_owner`).
* Validate all upgrade targets.
* Test upgrades across versions.
* Monitor upgrade events (`Upgraded`).
* Use empty data unless initialization is needed.
* Ensure new implementations return the correct `proxiable UUID`.
* **Enforce proxy context checks** — `only_proxy()` ensures upgrades cannot be called directly on the implementation.

== Common Pitfalls

* Forgetting access control.
* Direct calls to upgrade logic (not via proxy).
* Missing `proxiable UUID` validation.
* Changing storage layout without planning.
* Sending ETH to constructor without data (will revert).

== Use Cases

* Upgradeable tokens standards (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155).
* Modular DeFi protocols.
* DAO frameworks.
* NFT marketplaces.
* Access control registries.
* Cross-chain bridges.
