= ERC-20

An ERC-20 token contract keeps track of xref:tokens.adoc#different-kinds-of-tokens[_fungible_ tokens]: any token is exactly equal to any other token; no token has a special right or behavior associated with them.
This makes ERC-20 tokens useful for things like a *medium of exchange currency*, *voting rights*, *staking*, and more.

OpenZeppelin Contracts provide many ERC20-related contracts for Arbitrum Stylus.
On the https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/0.1.1/openzeppelin_stylus/token/erc20/struct.Erc20.html[`API reference`] you'll find detailed information on their properties and usage.

== Constructing an ERC-20 Token Contract

Using Contracts, we can easily create our own ERC-20 token contract, which will be used to track _Gold_ (GLD), an internal currency in a hypothetical game.

Here's what our GLD token might look like.

[source,rust]
----
sol_storage! {
    #[entrypoint]
    struct GLDToken {
        #[borrow]
        Erc20 erc20;
        #[borrow]
        Erc20Metadata metadata;
    }
}

#[public]
#[inherit(Erc20, Erc20Metadata)]
impl GLDToken {}
----

Our contracts are often used via stylus-sdk https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#inheritance-inherit-and-borrow[inheritance], and here we're reusing https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/0.1.1/openzeppelin_stylus/token/erc20/struct.Erc20.html[`ERC20`] for both the basic standard implementation and with optional extensions.

[[a-note-on-decimals]]
== A Note on `decimals`

Often, you'll want to be able to divide your tokens into arbitrary amounts: say, if you own `5 GLD`, you may want to send `1.5 GLD` to a friend, and keep `3.5 GLD` to yourself.
Unfortunately, Solidity and the EVM do not support this behavior: only integer (whole) numbers can be used, which poses an issue.
You may send `1` or `2` tokens, but not `1.5`.

To work around this, ERC20 provides a https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/0.1.1/openzeppelin_stylus/token/erc20/extensions/metadata/trait.IErc20Metadata.html#tymethod.decimals[`decimals`] field, which is used to specify how many decimal places a token has.
To be able to transfer `1.5 GLD`, `decimals` must be at least `1`, since that number has a single decimal place.

How can this be achieved?
It's actually very simple: a token contract can use larger integer values, so that a balance of `50` will represent `5 GLD`, a transfer of `15` will correspond to `1.5 GLD` being sent, and so on.

It is important to understand that `decimals` is _only used for display purposes_.
All arithmetic inside the contract is still performed on integers, and it is the different user interfaces (wallets, exchanges, etc.) that must adjust the displayed values according to `decimals`.
The total token supply and balance of each account are not specified in `GLD`: you need to divide by `10 ** decimals` to get the actual `GLD` amount.

You'll probably want to use a `decimals` value of `18`, just like Ether and most ERC-20 token contracts in use, unless you have an exceptional reason not to.
When minting tokens or transferring them around, you will be actually sending the number `GLD * (10 ** decimals)`.

NOTE: By default, `ERC20` uses a value of `18` for `decimals`.

To use a different value, you will need to override the `decimals()` function in your contract. For example, to use `16` decimals, you would do:

[source,rust]
----
pub fn decimals(&self) -> u8 {
    16
}
----

So if you want to send `5` tokens using a token contract with `18` decimals, the method to call will actually be:

[source,rust]
----
token.transfer(recipient, 5 * uint!(10_U256).pow(uint!(18_U256)));
----

[[erc20-token-extensions]]
== Extensions
Additionally, there are multiple custom extensions, including:

 * xref:erc20-burnable.adoc[ERC-20 Burnable]: destruction of own tokens.

 * xref:erc20-capped.adoc[ERC-20 Capped]: enforcement of a cap to the total supply when minting tokens.

 * xref:erc20-metadata.adoc[ERC-20 Metadata]: the extended ERC20 interface including the name, symbol, and decimals functions.

 * xref:erc20-pausable.adoc[ERC-20 Pausable]: ability to pause token transfers.

 * xref:erc20-permit.adoc[ERC-20 Permit]: gasless approval of tokens (standardized as https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[`EIP-2612`]).
