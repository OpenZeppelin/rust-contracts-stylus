= Deploying Contracts

To deploy a contract written in Rust using the Stylus SDK, the Arbitrum Stylus team created `cargo-stylus`. For now, this CLI tool doesn't support deploying contracts with constructors.

We implemented https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/koba[`koba`], a solution you can use today to write constructors in Solidity for your Rust smart contracts.

NOTE: Deploying `oppenzeppelin-stylus` contracts must be done using `koba`. Using `cargo-stylus` directly may initialize storage with unexpected values.

This solution is meant to be temporary. In the near future, we expect support for constructors to be implemented in `cargo-stylus` or the Stylus VM itself.

== Constructors

Deployment transactions in Ethereum are composed of three sections:

* A `prelude` - The bytecode prefix whose execution gets triggered by the deployment transaction.
* A `runtime` - The bytecode of the smart contract stored on-chain.
* Constructor arguments - ABI-encoded arguments received by the constructor.

The prelude section is a https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#constructors[smart contract constructor] compiled to bytecode. The runtime is the rest of the smart contract. All three sections combined are called `*binary*`.

Deployment transactions with an input of only compressed wasm are not yet supported in Stylus. That is, only the `runtime` is actual webassembly.

Moreover, the prelude of deployment transactions using `cargo-stylus` is https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus/blob/be9faca7720b534de7ec210fa5a071eae79824ec/check/src/deploy.rs#L102-L114[hard-coded].

`koba` solves this by putting together the Solidity constructor, the compiled webassembly and the abi-encoded constructor arguments. It can be used both as a CLI tool or as a library in Rust projects. For a complete example of using `koba` as a library, see the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/rust-contracts-stylus/blob/main/examples/basic/README.md[basic token example]. For an example of deploying a contract using the command line see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/koba#koba-deploy[koba's README].

== Usage

For a contract like this:

[source,rust]
----
sol_storage! {
    #[entrypoint]
    pub struct Counter {
        uint256 number;
    }
}

#[public]
impl Counter {
    pub fn number(&self) -> U256 {
        self.number.get()
    }

    pub fn increment(&mut self) {
        let number = self.number.get();
        self.set_number(number + U256::from(1));
    }
}
----

and a constructor like this:

[source,solidity]
----
contract Counter {
    uint256 private _number;

    constructor() {
        _number = 5;
    }
}
----

The following command will deploy your contract:

[source,bash]
----
$ koba deploy --sol <path-to-constructor> --wasm <path-to-wasm> --args <constructor-arguments> -e <rpc-url> --private-key <private-key>
----
