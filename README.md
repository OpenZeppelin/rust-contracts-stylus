# OpenZeppelin Contracts for Stylus

**A library for secure smart contract development** written in Rust for
[Arbitrum Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction).

## Features

- Security-first smart contracts, ported from the [`openzeppelin-contracts`]
  library.
- First-class `no_std` support.
- Solidity constructors powered by [`koba`].
- [Unit] and [integration] test affordances, used in our own tests.

[`openzeppelin-contracts`]: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

[`koba`]: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/koba

[Unit]: ./lib/motsu/README.md

[integration]: ./lib/e2e/README.md

## Usage

You can import OpenZeppelin Contracts from crates.io by adding the following
line to your `Cargo.toml` (We recommend pinning to a specific version):

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin-stylus = "0.1.1"
```

Optionally, you can specify a git dependency if you want to have the latest
changes from the `main` branch:

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin-stylus = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/rust-contracts-stylus" }
```

> [!NOTE]
> This library is designed to be `no_std`, which helps reduce wasm size. If you want your project to be `no_std` as well, ensure that your dependencies are not importing the standard library.
>You can achieve this by setting `default-features = false` for relevant dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`. For example:
>
> ```toml
> [dependencies]
> alloy-primitives = { version = "=0.7.6", default-features = false }
>
> ```
>
> You will also need to define your own panic handler for `cargo stylus check` to pass.
> Here's an example of a simple panic handler you can use in your `lib.rs` file:
>
> ```rust
> #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
> #[panic_handler]
> fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
>     loop {}
> }
> ```
>
> The library also works on an `std` environment, without the need to define a panic handler or making extra changes to your project.

Once defined as a dependency, use one of our pre-defined implementations by
importing them:

```rust
use openzeppelin_stylus::token::erc20::Erc20;

sol_storage! {
    #[entrypoint]
    struct Erc20Example {
        #[borrow]
        Erc20 erc20;
    }
}

#[public]
#[inherit(Erc20)]
impl Erc20Example {}
```
