//! This contract implements an upgradeable proxy. It is upgradeable because
//! calls are delegated to an implementation address that can be changed. This
//! address is stored in storage in the location specified by
//! [ERC-1967], so that it doesn't conflict with the storage layout of the
//! implementation behind the proxy.
//!
