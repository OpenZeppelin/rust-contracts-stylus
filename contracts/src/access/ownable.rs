//! Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
//! there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
//! specific functions.
//!
//! The initial owner is set to the address provided by the deployer. This can
//! later be changed with [`Ownable::transfer_ownership`].
//!
//! This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
//! [`Ownable::only_owner`] function, which can be called to restrict operations
//! to the owner.
