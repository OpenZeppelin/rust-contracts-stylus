//! Contract module which provides an access control mechanism, where
//! there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
//! specific functions.
//!
//! This extension of the `Ownable` contract includes a two-step mechanism to
//! transfer ownership, where the new owner must call
//! [`Ownable2Step::accept_ownership`] in order to replace the old one. This can
//! help prevent common mistakes, such as transfers of ownership to
//! incorrect accounts, or to contracts that are unable to interact with the
//! permission system.
//!
//! The initial owner is set to the address provided by the deployer. This can
//! later be changed with [`Ownable2Step::transfer_ownership`] and
//! [`Ownable2Step::accept_ownership`].
//!
//! This module uses [`Ownable`] as a member, and makes all its public functions
//! available.
