//! A vesting wallet handles the vesting of Ether and ERC-20 tokens for a given
//! beneficiary.
//!
//! A vesting wallet is an ownable contract that can receive native currency and
//! [`crate::token::erc20::Erc20`] tokens, and release these assets to the
//! wallet owner, also referred to as "beneficiary", according to a vesting
//! schedule.
//!
//! Any assets transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as
//! if they were locked from the beginning. Consequently, if the vesting has
//! already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least
//! partly) be immediately releasable.
//!
//! By setting the duration to 0, one can configure this contract to behave like
//! an asset timelock that hold tokens for a beneficiary until a specified time.
//!
//! NOTE: Since the wallet is [`Ownable`], and ownership
//! can be transferred, it is possible to sell unvested tokens. Preventing this
//! in a smart contract is difficult, considering that: 1) a beneficiary address
//! could be a counterfactually deployed contract, 2) there is likely to be a
//! migration path for EOAs to become contracts in the near future.
//!
//! NOTE: When using this contract with any token whose balance is adjusted
//! automatically (i.e. a rebase token), make sure to account the supply/balance
//! adjustment in the vesting schedule to ensure the vested amount is as
//! intended.
