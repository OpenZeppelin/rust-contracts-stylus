[lib]
# The Stylus team sets new crates with the following types:
# `lib` - The default, which gets turned to `rlib` by cargo and is needed to
# link the crate as a dependency of binaries.
# `cdylib` - A dynamic system library to be loaded from `wasm`.
#
# See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html>
#
# This means our crate would be built twice: once as a rust library and once as
# a dynamic library. When running `cargo test`, cargo invokes rustc twice, but
# when it build the rust library, it doesn't set the `test` feature flag, so we
# can't use it.
#
# The reason to add `lib` is to be able to use the `export-abi` feature of the
# SDK. We don't set `lib` here because our contracts are meant to be used as an
# addition to other contracts. For this use case, the abi of those contracts
# will contain ours.
# 
# The trade-off is being able to run `cargo test` with conditional compilation
# vs being able to run `cargo stylus export-abi`.
# 
# This may change in the future, so this behavior should not be relied upon.
